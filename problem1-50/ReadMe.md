# Notes
My solution code for problems from 1 (two sum) to 50 (Pow (x,n)).

## Part1
This part includes solution code from problem 1 to 2
For problem 1, 

- We could use c++ unordered map find(), which is faster than map.
- I noted down here that using {num1, num2} to return as vector would still improve the speed.

## Part2
