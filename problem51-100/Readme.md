# Notes
My solution code for problems 51 (N-Queens) to 100 (Same Tree). File naming from "part11.cpp" to "part20.cpp". (Every 5 problems in one part)

## Part 11
Code from problems 51 (N-Queens) to 55 ().

For Problem 51 (N-Queens), typical backtracing. But remember use one for loop by increasing row number.

For Problem 52 (N-Queens II), counting version of P51.
- A faster code trick is to use 3 one-dimenstional vectors instead of two dim bool arrays, reduces time costs from 200ms+ to about 4ms. (New solution code are uploaded)

For Problem 53. (Maximum Subarray),
